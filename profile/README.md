# **MaininiLab**

## About Us

We are a research group within the **Brahmal Vasudevan Institute for Sustainable Aviation** at Imperial College London. Our mission is to drive the transformation of aviation towards sustainability through cutting-edge research in aerodynamics, propulsion, computational design, and multidisciplinary optimization.

## Our Research

We focus on:

- Hydrogen-powered and low-carbon aircraft design
- Advanced computational methods for aerospace systems
- Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO)
- Digital engineering and scientific machine learning
- Real-time data-driven decision-making for aerospace applications

## Leadership

The group is led by **Professor Laura Mainini**, Chair in Aerospace Computational Design at the Department of Aeronautics and Associate Director of the Brahmal Institute.

## Get Involved

We collaborate with academia, industry, and policymakers to accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation. For inquiries and collaborations, please visit our [institute website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/brahmal-institute/).
